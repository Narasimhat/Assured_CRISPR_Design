// Which guides to offer for an insertion or point-mutation design.
//
// The engine documents its guide ranking as "blockability first, distance second, within a
// distance window". For a long time the code did not do that: it took the nearest guide and
// one distinct partner by proximity and strand alone, and only then ranked those two by how
// well each could be blocked. A guide that could be blocked better never reached the ranking
// if it sat within 10 bp of the nearest guide's cut - on NR2F2 the 40% GC guide at -14 bp was
// discarded for being 2 bp from a guide at -12 bp that grades one tier lower.
//
// This module holds the pair choice as a pure function of already-scored candidates, so the
// ordering rule can be tested without a reference sequence. It stays free of React and of
// Vite-only globals so `node --test` can load it.

 * @returns {object[]} the lead guide first, then its partner. Among partners of the same
 *   protection and composition class the opposite strand is preferred, then proximity. When no
