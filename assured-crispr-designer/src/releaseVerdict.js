// The one release verdict a design gets, and the words used to state it.
//
// The downloaded HTML report has led with this since the report layer was extracted. The
// on-screen report never stated it at all: it rendered its own nine-row checklist that
// graded a hard blocker as "warn", so the screen a reviewer actually looks at was the one
// surface that would not say "BLOCKED". Two surfaces describing the same design in
// different words is the failure this module exists to prevent - they now read the same
// status, label, lead sentence and reason lists from here.
//
// Keep this free of React and of Vite-only globals so `node --test` can load it.
